 Abseil is an open-source collection of C++ library code designed to
 augment the C++ standard library. The Abseil library code is collected
 from Google's C++ codebase and has been extensively tested and used in
 production. In some cases, Abseil provides pieces missing from the C++
 standard; in others, Abseil provides alternatives to the standard for
 special needs.
